## Flexbox

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| alignContent | [oneOf](#oneof) `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around` | | `alignContent` controls how rows align in the cross direction, overriding the `alignContent` of the parent. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content> for more details. |
| alignItems | [oneOf](#oneof) `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `baseline` | stretch | `alignItems` aligns children in the cross direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `alignItems` controls how they align horizontally. It works like `align-items` in CSS, except the default value is `stretch` instead of `flex-start`. See <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/> for more detail. |
| alignSelf | [oneOf](#oneof) `auto`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `baseline` | auto | controls how a child aligns in the cross direction, overriding the `alignItems` of the parent. It works like `align-self` in CSS. See <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-self/> for more detail. |
| aspectRatio | [number](#number) | | `aspectRatio` controls the size of the undefined dimension of a node. `aspectRatio` is a non-standard property only available in React Native and not CSS. On a node with a set `width`/`height` `aspectRatio` controls the size of the unset dimension. On a node with a set `flexBasis` `aspectRatio` controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset. On a node with a `measure` function `aspectRatio` works as though the `measure` function measures the `flexBasis`. On a node with `flexGrow`/`flexShrink` `aspectRatio` controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset. `aspectRatio` takes min/max dimensions into account. |
| borderBottomWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | `borderBottomWidth` works like `border-bottom-width` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp> for more details. |
| borderLeftWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | `borderLeftWidth` works like `border-left-width` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp> for more details. |
| borderRightWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | `borderRightWidth` works like `border-right-width` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-right_width.asp> for more details. |
| borderTopWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | `borderTopWidth` works like `border-top-width` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-top_width.asp> for more details. |
| borderEndWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | When direction is ltr, `borderEndWidth` is equivalent to `borderRightWidth`. When direction is rtl, `borderEndWidth` is equivalent to `borderLeftWidth`. |
| borderStartWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | When direction is ltr, `borderStartWidth` is equivalent to `borderLeftWidth`. When direction is rtl, `borderStartWidth` is equivalent to `borderRightWidth`. |
| borderWidth | [number](#number) | 0 | `borderWidth` works like `border-width` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-width.asp> for more details. |
| bottom | [number](#number) | auto* | `bottom` is the number of logical pixels to offset the bottom edge of this component. It works similarly to `bottom` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom> for more details of how `bottom` affects layout. |
| direction | [oneOf](#oneof) `inherit`, `ltr`, `rtl` | `inherit` | `direction` specifies the directional flow of the user interface. The default is `inherit`, except for root node which will have value based on the current locale. See <https://facebook.github.io/yoga/docs/rtl/> for more details. |
| display | [oneOf](#oneof) `none`, `flex` | `flex` | `display` sets the display type of this component. It works similarly to `display` in CSS, but only support 'flex' and 'none'. |
| end | [number](#number) | auto* | When the direction is `ltr`, `end` is equivalent to `right`. When the direction is `rtl`, `end` is equivalent to `left`. This style takes precedence over the `left` and `right` styles. |
| start | [number](#number) | auto* | When the direction is `ltr`, `start` is equivalent to `left`. When the direction is `rtl`, `start` is equivalent to `right`. This style takes precedence over the `left`, `right`, and `end` styles. |
| flex | [number](#number) | 0 | In React Native `flex` does not work the same way that it does in CSS. `flex` is a number rather than a string, and it works according to the `css-layout` library at <https://github.com/facebook/css-layout> . When `flex` is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with `flex` set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with `flex` set to 1. When `flex` is 0, the component is sized according to `width` and `height` and it is inflexible. When `flex` is -1, the component is normally sized according `width` and `height`. However, if there's not enough space, the component will shrink to its `minWidth` and `minHeight`. `flexGrow`, `flexShrink` and `flexBasis` work the same as in CSS. |
| flexDirection | [oneOf](#oneof) `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse` | column | `flexDirection` controls which directions children of a container go. `row` goes left to right, `column` goes top to bottom, and you may be able to guess what the other two do. It works like `flex-direction` in CSS, except the default is `column`. See <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-direction/> for more detail. |
| flexBasis | [number](#number) | 0 | |
| flexGrow | [number](#number) | 0 | |
| flexShrink | [number](#number) | 0 | |
| flexWrap | [oneOf](#oneof) `wrap`, `nowrap` | nowrap | `flexWrap` controls whether children can wrap around after they hit the end of a flex container. It works like `flex-wrap` in CSS. See <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-wrap/> for more detail. |
| height | [number](#number) | auto* | `height` sets the height of this component. It works similarly to `height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp> for more details. |
| justifyContent | [oneOf](#oneof) `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around` | flex-start | `justifyContent` aligns children in the main direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `justifyContent` controls how they align vertically. It works like `justify-content` in CSS. See <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/> for more detail. |
| left | [number](#number) | auto* | `left` is the number of logical pixels to offset the left edge of this component. It works similarly to `left` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left> for more details of how `left` affects layout. |
| margin | [number](#number) | 0 | Setting `margin` has the same effect as setting each of `marginTop`, `marginLeft`, `marginBottom`, and `marginRight`. |
| marginBottom | [number](#number) | 0 | `marginBottom` works like `margin-bottom` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-bottom.asp> for more details. |
| marginHorizontal | [number](#number) | 0 | Setting `marginHorizontal` has the same effect as setting both `marginLeft` and `marginRight`. |
| marginLeft | [number](#number) | 0 | `marginLeft` works like `margin-left` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-left.asp> for more details. |
| marginRight | [number](#number) | 0 | `marginRight` works like `margin-right` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-right.asp> for more details. |
| marginTop | [number](#number) | 0 | `marginTop` works like `margin-top` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-top.asp> for more details. |
| marginVertical | [number](#number) | 0 | Setting `marginVertical` has the same effect as setting both `marginTop` and `marginBottom`. |
| marginEnd | [number](#number) | 0 | When direction is `ltr`, `marginEnd` is equivalent to `marginRight`. When direction is `rtl`, `marginEnd` is equivalent to `marginLeft`.|
| marginStart | [number](#number) | 0 | When direction is `ltr`, `marginStart` is equivalent to `marginLeft`. When direction is `rtl`, `marginStart` is equivalent to `marginRight`. |
| maxHeight | [number](#number) | auto* | `maxHeight` is the maximum height for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `max-height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-height.asp> for more details. |
| maxWidth | [number](#number) | auto* | `maxWidth` is the maximum width for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `max-width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-width.asp> for more details. |
| minHeight | [number](#number) | auto* | `minHeight` is the minimum height for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `min-height` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-height.asp> for more details. |
| minWidth | [number](#number) | auto* | `minWidth` is the minimum width for this component, in logical pixels. It works similarly to `min-width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_min-width.asp> for more details. |
| padding | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | `padding` works like `padding` in CSS. It's like setting each of `paddingTop`, `paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft`, and `paddingRight` to the same thing. See <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp> for more details. |
| paddingBottom | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | `paddingBottom` works like `padding-bottom` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-bottom.asp> for more details. |
| paddingHorizontal | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | Setting `paddingHorizontal` is like setting both of `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight`. |
| paddingLeft | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | `paddingLeft` works like `padding-left` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-left.asp> for more details. |
| paddingRight | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | `paddingRight` works like `padding-right` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-right.asp> for more details. |
| paddingTop | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | `paddingTop` works like `padding-top` in CSS. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding-top.asp> for more details. |
| paddingVertical | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | Setting `paddingVertical` is like setting both of `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`. |
| paddingEnd | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | When direction is `ltr`, `paddingEnd` is equivalent to `paddingRight`. When direction is `rtl`, `paddingEnd` is equivalent to `paddingLeft`. |
| paddingStart | [number](#number), [string](#string) | 0 | When direction is `ltr`, `paddingStart` is equivalent to `paddingLeft`. When direction is `rtl`, `paddingStart` is equivalent to `paddingRight`. |
| position | [oneOf](#oneof) `absolute`, `relative` | relative | `position` in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to `relative` by default, so `absolute` positioning is always just relative to the parent. If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have `absolute` position. If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, just don't use styles for that. Use the component tree. See <https://github.com/facebook/css-layout> for more details on how `position` differs between React Native and CSS. |
| right | [number](#number) | auto* | `right` is the number of logical pixels to offset the right edge of this component. It works similarly to `right` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right> for more details of how `right` affects layout. |
| top | [number](#number) | auto* | `top` is the number of logical pixels to offset the top edge of this component. It works similarly to `top` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top> for more details of how `top` affects layout. |
| width | [number](#number) | auto* | `width` sets the width of this component. It works similarly to `width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp> for more details. |
| zIndex | [number](#number) | auto* | `zIndex` controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use `zIndex`. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. `zIndex` may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior. It works like the CSS `z-index` property - components with a larger `zIndex` will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index> for more detail. |

- properties with default value `auto` marked with asterisk are do not actually have `auto` as their default value, they just behave like if they would in *css* if they had `auto` as their value. `auto` is not valid value for those properties in react-native
